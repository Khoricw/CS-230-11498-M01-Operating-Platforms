The Gaming Room needed a web-based game application called "Draw It or Lose It," where players guess images under timed conditions. I successfully detailed the system architecture and addressed the need to manage multiple game instances and high-definition images across various platforms. The design document was instrumental in structuring the development process and aligning it with the client's requirements.

If I were to revise any part of the documentation, I would enhance the sections on memory and storage management to include more specific optimization strategies. Understanding and implementing user needs was crucial to ensure the applicationâ€™s functionality and user experience. My design approach involved breaking down requirements into manageable parts and using design patterns for efficiency. In future projects, I would use this approach while incorporating feedback to refine the design before full-scale development.
